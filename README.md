# Data Science Portfolio

**by Bo Tian**

This portfolio contains my data science projects, related practices, and certificates. Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

## Projects

In this project, I built a [Streamlit web app](https://share.streamlit.io/ashaabrizvi/credit_card_clients_default/creditcard.py) to predict customer credit card default. This app is meant to check how effective our model is for Credit Card Default Prediction with the help of evaluation metrices.

This is an end-to-end machine learning project on Google Cloud Platform. I first used [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) and [Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs) to perform exploratory data analysis with 42 GB of user log and transaction data from Kaggle's [WSDM — KKBox’s Churn Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge), then I trained and deployed Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict the likelihood of the customer churn over time.

In this project, I analyzed 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users to predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. I also performed customer segmentation and affinity analysis to understand user purchase patterns.

In this project, I built an end-to-end stock portfolio watcher dashboard application that utilizes machine learning to predict the rating of a stock against the rating the stock is given by analysts in the industry.

In this project,  I built a time series anomaly detection model using LSTM autoencoder (via the Keras API with Tensorflow 2) to detect sudden price changes in the S&P 500 index. I have also created interactive charts and plots using Plotly Python and Seaborn for data visualization and display our results in Jupyter notebooks.

In this project, as a small contribution to DC VISION ZERO initiative, I used tableau to visualize DC traffice accidents so as to find patterns in traffice accidents and hence facilitate further suggestions for road safety.
