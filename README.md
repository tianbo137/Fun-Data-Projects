# Data Science Portfolio

**by Bo Tian**

This portfolio contains my data science projects, related practices, and certificates. Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

## Projects

In this end-to-end machine learning project, we developed an XGBoost model and served it on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using AI Platform. The objective of our work is to predict whether a user of the music streaming service KKBox will “churn”, i.e. leave this subscription-based service, by analysing the user’s behaviour on the website.

In this project, I built a [Streamlit web app]() to predict NBA game result. In order for this model to be profitable, I designed the backend predicative model as a feedforward neural network using player level features and game odds as input together with a custom loss function to decorrelate from the bookies.

In this project, I built an end-to-end stock portfolio watcher dashboard application that utilizes machine learning to predict the rating of a stock against the rating the stock is given by analysts in the industry.

In this project, I used simulated data from the Starbucks rewards app to predict the propensity of a user to take up an offer. This project is inspired by this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-starbucks-app-user-data-to-predict-effective-offers-20b799f3a6d5).

This project contains my solution to Udacity's A/B testing course final project. More specifically, we try to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to help the company understand if they should implement a new webpage, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

In this project, as a small contribution to DC VISION ZERO initiative, I used tableau to visualize DC traffice accidents so as to find patterns in traffice accidents and hence facilitate further suggestions for road safety.
