## Side Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/customer-churn.jpg"> **[Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)**

In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku. 

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/instacart.jpg"> **[Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/tree/main/Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis)**

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets (Content-based filtering).

Objective of this project is to perform predictive assesment on the GDP of India through an inferential analysis of various socio-economic factors. Various models are compared and Stepwise Regression model is implemented which resulted in 5.7% Test MSE. [App](https://churn-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/)

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.
