# Data Science Portfolio

**by Bo Tian**

This portfolio contains my data science projects, related practices, and certificates. Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

## Projects



<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/customer-churn.jpg"> **[End-to-end ML Model on GCP --- Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)**

This is an end-to-end machine learning project using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), [Looker](https://looker.com/platform/overview), and [AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform) of the Google Cloud Platform. More specifically, I used BigQuery to perform data cleaning and aggregation with 42 GB of customer data from Kaggle's [KKBoxâ€™s Churn Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge), then I built and deployed an XGBoost model using AI Platform together with visualization using Google Looker.

In this project, I built a [Streamlit web app]() to predict NBA game result. In order for this model to be profitable, I designed the backend predicative model as a feedforward neural network using player level features and game odds as input together with a custom loss function to decorrelate from the bookies.

In this project, I analyzed 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users to predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. I also performed customer segmentation and affinity analysis to understand user purchase patterns.

In this project, I built an end-to-end stock portfolio watcher dashboard application that utilizes machine learning to predict the rating of a stock against the rating the stock is given by analysts in the industry.

This project contains my solution to Udacity's A/B testing course final project. More specifically, we try to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to help the company understand if they should implement a new webpage, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

In this project, as a small contribution to DC VISION ZERO initiative, I used tableau to visualize DC traffice accidents so as to find patterns in traffice accidents and hence facilitate further suggestions for road safety.
