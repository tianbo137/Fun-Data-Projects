# Data Science Portfolio

**by Bo Tian**

This portfolio contains my data science projects, related practices, and certificates. Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

## Projects

In this project, I built a [Streamlit web app](https://share.streamlit.io/ashaabrizvi/credit_card_clients_default/creditcard.py) to predict customer credit card default. This app is meant to check how effective our model is for Credit Card Default Prediction with the help of evaluation metrices.

This is an end-to-end project, where I first used [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) and [Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs) of Google Cloud Platform to perform exploratory data analysis with 42 GB of user log and transaction data from Kaggle's [WSDM — KKBox’s Churn Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge), and then I trained and deployed Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict the likelihood of the customer churn over time.

In this project, I analyzed 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users to predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. I also performed customer segmentation and affinity analysis to understand user purchase patterns.

In this project, I built a hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets (Content-based filtering).

In this project,  I built a time series anomaly detection model using LSTM autoencoder (via the Keras API with Tensorflow 2) to detect sudden price changes in the S&P 500 index. I have also created interactive charts and plots using Plotly Python and Seaborn for data visualization and display our results in Jupyter notebooks.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/DC-TRAFFIC1.jpg"> **[DC Traffic Crash Visualization](https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/tree/main/Visualizing-DC-Traffic-Crashes)**
 
In this project, as a small contribution to DC VISION ZERO initiative, I used tableau to visualize DC traffice accidents so as to find patterns in traffice accidents and hence facilitate further suggestions for road safety.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/drug.jpg"> **[UCI Drug Review and Recommendation](https://github.com/tianbo137/My_Portfolio/tree/main/UCI_Drug_Review_and_Recommendation)**
 
In this project, I went through hands on analysis on UCI ML Drug Review dataset and build a simple item-based medication recommendation system given customer's medical condition.
