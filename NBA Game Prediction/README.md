## Overview



In this project, I attempt to build a profitable NBA game winners prediction model against the odds of those Las Vegas bookies. In particular, I will be using player game-level stats pulled from the [NBA stats website](http://stats.nba.com/) with [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) together with game odds from [covers.com](http://covers.com) using the Python web scraping framework [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). 



## Contents:

- [odds_data](): Scrapy project to scrape point spreads and over/under lines from
- [game_data](): Python module with support functions to perform tasks including collecting stats to a SQLite database, simulating seasons, and customizing plots
- [notebooks](): Jupyter notebooks of all analyses
