## Overview

In this project, I attempt to build a profitable NBA game winners prediction model against the odds of bookmakers. 

The data includes player game-level stats pulled from the [NBA stats website](http://stats.nba.com/) with [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) and game odds from [covers.com](http://covers.com) using the Python web scraping framework [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). 

The model is a wide-and-deep neural network model together with a custom loss function to assist us identifying fair odds.

## Contents:

- [odds_data](): Scrapy project to scrape point spreads and over/under lines from
- [game_data](): Python module with support functions to perform tasks including collecting stats to a SQLite database, simulating seasons, and customizing plots
- [notebooks](): Jupyter notebooks of all analyses


## What is covered
- Data wrangling with Pandas & data storage with SQLite
- Machine learning (Neural Network) with Keras
- Web app with Flask (and a bit of CSS & HTML)
- App deployment with Docker and Heroku
