## Data 

I collected traffic accident data from [Open Data DC](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/70392a096a8e431381f1f692aaa06afd_24) for the past 5 years.

In this project, we will use the Metropolitan Police Department's (MPD) crash data provided by District of Columbia and maintained by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT).

The data is provided as a CSV and consists of the time of accident, the geographical coordinates, and other information such as cause of accident, vehicles involved, fatalities, etc. 

## Objective

Here are the steps I took for the project:

* I collected, cleaned, and analyzed the data.
* Created heat maps â€” static and with time that shows accidents by location, for the year, over a map of NJ, for visualization.
