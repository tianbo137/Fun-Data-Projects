## Data 

In this project, we will use the Metropolitan Police Department's (MPD) crash data for the past 5 years provided and maintained by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) of the District of Columbia government.
* [https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/70392a096a8e431381f1f692aaa06afd_24](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/70392a096a8e431381f1f692aaa06afd_24)

The data is provided as a CSV and consists of the time of accident, the geographical coordinates, and other information such as cause of accident, vehicles involved, fatalities, etc. 

## Objective

The aim of this project is to use data science methodology to gain insights and develop prevention suggestions for Traffic Accidents and Road Safety in District of Columbia, a small contribution to the [DC Vision Zero Initiative](https://www.dcvisionzero.com/).

## Steps

Here are the steps I took for the project:

* I collected, cleaned, and analyzed the data.
* Created heat maps â€” static and with time that shows accidents by location, for the year, over a map of DC, for visualization.

To better guide us through the analysis, I formulated the problem into the following set of questions: 
* Which type of accidents are more fatal?
* When do accidents usually happen?
* Where do accidents usually happen?
* Under which circumstances do accidents happen? Is there any correlation between these features? 
* What is the age distribution of drivers involved in the accidents?
* What are the characteristics of casualties impacted in the accidents?
* What are the main factors causing an accidents, and what measures can be taken to effectively deal with these problems?
