## Data 

I collected traffic accident data from [Open Data DC](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/70392a096a8e431381f1f692aaa06afd_24) for the past 5 years.

## Objective

Here are the steps I took for the project:

* I collected, cleaned, and analyzed the data.
* Created heat maps â€” static and with time that shows accidents by location, for the year, over a map of NJ, for visualization.
