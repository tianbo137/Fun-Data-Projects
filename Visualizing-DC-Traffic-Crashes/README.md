In this project, we will use the Metropolitan Police Department's (MPD) crash data for the past 5 yearsprovided by District of Columbia and maintained by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT).

The data is provided as a CSV and consists of the time of accident, the geographical coordinates, and other information such as cause of accident, vehicles involved, fatalities, etc. 

## Objective

Here are the steps I took for the project:

* I collected, cleaned, and analyzed the data.
* Created heat maps â€” static and with time that shows accidents by location, for the year, over a map of NJ, for visualization.
