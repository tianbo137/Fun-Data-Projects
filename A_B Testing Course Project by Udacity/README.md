# A/B Testing Course Project by Udacity


Udacity published a great free course for A/B Testing, also known as split tests, which are online experiments used to test potential improvements to a website or mobile app.  This course focuses on design and analysis of A/B tests, in particular, it course covers how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power and how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions.

This project presents a walkthrough solution of the course final project, that is, I work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
